1)When a new mall is in the process of being added, and then 
we add a shop without any subcategory, then the submit fails

2)The modal to add shop requires validation in 'level' property with respect to its mall's level.
3) Same goes with the time gap of 1 30 mins.


4) in editForm replace mallTiming with shopTiming.
5) in the mall edit form, the uncaught error about 1hr 30mins gap is detected, but the form is submitted any way 

Features to add
i) Delete icon for shop with functionality
ii) implement validation for the above found points
